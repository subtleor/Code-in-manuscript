'relation.ncl' and 'relationq700.ncl' are used to plot Figure 1-6
In this part,we used 'dTdt_anom.TQ_5terms.year_mon_daily-ave.1980-2020.ncl' and 'advT.ncl' to calculate diabatic heating and horizontal temperature advection.And the integration of horizontal temperature advection at different altitudes  need to use 'integration.ncl'
'poumian_q.ncl' is used to draw longitudeâ€“height cross section of diabatic heating;
'relation4d_u.ncl' is used to draw 200-hPa zonal wind anomaly
'relation_zuv.ncl' is used to draw geopotential height (shading; gpm) and wind at a specific level
'relationtadv.ncl' is used to draw advection of temperature anomaly

"relation_pre.ncl" is used to plot the tmp/pre pattern.(Figure 7a and 7c)
"relationq_div.ncl" is used to plot the WVT pattern (Figure 7d)
"xiepou.ncl" is used to plot the zonalâ€“vertical circulation. Before plotting the diagrams, the regression of the zonal wind, meridional wind, and vertical wind onto spring EIP_SMI must be calculated at first.
